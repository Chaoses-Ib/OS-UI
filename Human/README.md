# Human-centered Computing (HCC)
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_computing)

> Human-centered computing (HCC) studies the design, development, and deployment of mixed-initiative human-computer systems. It is emerged from the convergence of multiple disciplines that are concerned both with understanding human beings and with the design of computational artifacts.

> Human-centered computing is closely related to **human-computer interaction** and **information science**. Human-centered computing is usually concerned with systems and practices of technology use while human-computer interaction is more focused on ergonomics and the usability of computing artifacts and information science is focused on practices surrounding the collection, manipulation, and use of information.

> HCI is an aspect of HCC. HCI address the need for user-friendly interfaces and usability engineering, while HCC covers a much wider domain.
> 
> According toÂ [HCC Interdisciplinary Consortium at UC Berkeley](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jfc/hcc/), HCC is "conceived as a theme that is important for all computer-related research, not as a field which overlaps or is a sub-discipline of computer science."
> 
> HCC considers many factors HCI does not, including social/cultural awareness, the consideration/augmentation of human abilities, and the incorporation of applied learning, social and cognitive sciences into its approach.
