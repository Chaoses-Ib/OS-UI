# Personal Knowledge Management
**Personal knowledge management (PKM)** is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share knowledge in their daily activities and the way in which these processes support work activities. It is a response to the idea that knowledge workers need to be responsible for their own growth and learning. It is a bottom-up approach to knowledge management.[^pkm-wiki]

## Knowledge management vs Information management
有一种观点认为，知识是没有形体的，只有信息才有，因此知识管理实际上是一种信息管理。[^jones]但知识管理与信息管理的目标并不一致，信息管理更像是知识管理的实现手段，而非它的父集。
